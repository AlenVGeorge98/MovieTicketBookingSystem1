## Description
The purpose of the movie ticket booking system is to provide an alternate way for users to purchase movie tickets. The system offers separate login for users as well as the admin. After logging in, the users can view a list of movies, book tickets, search movies and view all the booked tickets under his/her name. New users need to register in the system in order to book tickets. Admin has the privileges to add movies and to view all bookings. 

The project is done using the concept of structures and file handling. All the details entered by the admin and the users are stored in a file and so the details are not lost when the program is terminated. The system hence provides a reliable method for storing and accessing data.
